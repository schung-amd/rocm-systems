# Design: faking external interfaces in amd-smi C++ unit tests

This document works through one concrete case — RAS block-enabled state and the
`ras/features` sysfs read — as the first application of a general, reusable,
two-layer pattern for testing amd-smi's real public API without real hardware.

## Motivation

`amdsmi_get_gpu_total_ecc_count()` had three bugs: it re-read RAS state up to 39
times per call (one read of `.../ras/features` per RAS block), which could trip
host-side RAS read throttling on SR-IOV guests; a failed mask read was silently
reported as a zero-error GPU instead of a real failure; and the per-block
accumulation loop only ever added to `*ec` (`+=`), so a caller passing in a
struct that wasn't already zeroed (or reused across calls) got a result
contaminated by whatever was already there, even on `AMDSMI_STATUS_SUCCESS`.
Fixing this exposed a broader gap: there was no way to unit-test amd-smi's public
API surface without real GPU hardware. This document is both the fix's regression
coverage and the general pattern for closing that gap elsewhere.

## Design goals

- Tests call the **real, unmodified public API** (e.g. `amdsmi_get_gpu_total_ecc_count()`)
  directly wherever possible, not an internal helper one layer down — the closer a
  test drives the actual entry point users call, the more of the real code path it
  covers.
- No environment-variable overrides. Any test-only redirection of paths or state
  must not live in a form that's checked in always-shipped, often-privileged
  production code. See "Why this is safe to ship" below for the mechanism actually
  used instead.
- Every override is RAII-guarded, never a bare "set and forget" setter — the only
  way to change any faked value is to construct a guard, which always restores the
  real value on scope exit, even on early test failure (`gtest`'s `ASSERT_*` return
  early rather than throwing, so destructors still run). This removes the "forgot
  to reset in TearDown" bug class by construction.
- The pattern generalizes across amd-smi's processor types (GPU, CPU, NIC, switch,
  AI-NIC), not just this one RAS fix. See "The two-layer pattern" below.

## The two-layer pattern

Every amd-smi public API call reaches its target processor through the same
dispatch: `get_gpu_device_from_handle()` (or its CPU/NIC/switch equivalents) calls
`AMDSmiSystem::handle_to_processor()`, which looks up the handle by pointer identity
in one of `AMDSmiSystem`'s private sets (`processors_`, `nic_processors_`,
`switch_processors_`, `ainic_processors_`). This holds **regardless of processor
type** — CPU sockets/cores are inserted into the exact same `processors_` set as
GPUs.

That gives a clean two-layer split for any future device-type test:

1. **Universal layer — build once, reuse everywhere.** A single seam on
   `AMDSmiSystem` registers/unregisters a synthetic processor into the correct set
   for the scope of a test (RAII-guarded, per the design goals above). The correct
   set is chosen from the processor's own `get_processor_type()` -- the same
   `amdsmi_processor_type_t` value the processor was already constructed with, not
   a separate parameter the test has to supply and keep in sync. Any future CPU,
   NIC, switch, or AI-NIC unit test reuses this exact mechanism with zero new
   registration code.
2. **Backend-specific layer — investigate per device type.** Once a fake processor
   is reachable through the public dispatch, whatever that processor's own methods
   touch underneath varies by type, and needs its own short investigation before
   assuming a seam is needed (or already exists):
   - **GPU**: `AMDSmiGPUDevice::get_mutex()` resolves through
     `RocmSMI::getInstance().devices()[gpu_id_]`. That vector is already public and
     mutable (`RocmSMI::devices()`), and `rocm_smi::Device`'s constructor is
     confirmed to only create a real named shared-memory mutex — no other hardware
     access — so a test can push a real, hardware-inert fake `Device` there
     directly. **No new seam was needed for this part at all.** Sysfs reads below
     that (like `ras/features`) still need their own small override — see "The RAS
     sysfs seam" below. The same reasoning extends to per-block RAS/ECC counter
     reads (`rsmi_dev_ecc_count_get()` -> `Device::openSysfsFileStream()`), which
     also build their path from the same `Device::path_` field a test already
     controls directly, rather than a separate hardcoded literal.
   - **CPU**: confirmed `AMDSmiProcessor` (the plain base class CPU processors use
     directly) has no `get_mutex()` at all, so CPU never hits the mutex/`RocmSMI`
     layer. Its data instead comes from ESMI (`esmi_init()`/`esmi_*` calls, a
     separate library for AMD CPU/HSMP telemetry). A future CPU unit test would
     need its own ESMI-call seam (same getter/setter-behind-a-guard shape as the
     RAS one below) — not something this work builds automatically.
   - **NIC / switch / AI-NIC**: already has its own seam,
     `nic_set_info_getters_for_testing()` (a struct-of-function-pointers swap, a
     different shape than the sysfs-root getter/setter used here, but the same
     RAII-guard discipline). One detail worth checking before relying on it for a
     mutex-adjacent test: `AMDSmiNICDevice::get_mutex()` resolves through the same
     `amd::smi::GetMutex()` helper as GPU, which indexes `RocmSMI::devices()` (the
     GPU vector) rather than `nic_devices()`/`switch_devices()`. Not chased down
     further here — flagged for whoever next writes a NIC test that needs a mutex
     to resolve.

## The RAS sysfs seam (this fix's concrete instance of layer 2)

Reusable test infrastructure (not RAS-specific) lives in
`tests/amd_smi_test/test_fixture_utils.h`/`.cc`:
- `FakeSysfsTree`: builds a real, temporary, hardware-inert file tree.
- A generic, header-only `ScopedOverride<T>` template: takes a getter, a setter, and
  a new value. Its constructor saves the current value and installs the new one;
  its destructor restores the saved value. Being fully templated/inline, it never
  crosses the shared-library ABI boundary, so it carries no export/visibility
  concerns of its own — reused by both the layer-1 processor-registration guard and
  this layer-2 sysfs-root guard, and available for any future interface (ioctl,
  libdrm loader, an ESMI seam for CPU, ...) without duplicating guard boilerplate.
- `ScopedProcessorRegistration`: the RAII wrapper around the layer-1
  `AMDSmiSystem::register_processor_for_testing()`/`unregister_processor_for_testing()`
  seam.
- `ScopedRocmSmiDevice` and `ScopedAmdsmiInit`: reusable by any GPU unit test
  needing a fake `rocm_smi::Device` or a no-hardware-discovery `amdsmi_init()`, not
  just this RAS fix.

The one piece that must live in production code (compiled into
`libamd_smi`/`amd_smi_static`, since production code calls the getter) stays in
`amd_smi_test_overrides.h`/`.cc`:
- The RAS-specific primitive: `smi_amdgpu_sysfs_drm_root()` (getter, called by
  production code) and `smi_amdgpu_set_sysfs_drm_root_for_testing()` (setter — only
  ever called by the guard). Both intentionally not `amdsmi_`-prefixed.

Each test uses the `FakeSysfsTree` fixture helper to build a real, temporary,
hardware-inert file tree, and constructs a real `AMDSmiDrm` + `AMDSmiGPUDevice`
pointing at it. Combined with the layer-1 processor-registration guard and the
layer-2 sysfs-root guard, a test can call the real, unmodified public
`amdsmi_get_gpu_total_ecc_count()` directly and observe its actual failure-handling
behavior — the thing this fix changed — with no real hardware involved.

## Why this is safe to ship (verified, not assumed)

- Every setter/registration method introduced by this pattern is not
  `amdsmi_`-prefixed, so `libamd_smi.so`'s linker version script — which only
  exports the `amdsmi_*` symbol glob — excludes it from the shared library's
  dynamic symbol table entirely. No external caller (the `amd-smi` CLI, Python
  `ctypes` bindings, any customer application linking the `.so`) can resolve or
  call it. This is a linker-level guarantee, not a convention — confirmed via the
  explicit comment in `src/CMakeLists.txt` describing which symbols the version
  script's `amdsmi_*` glob does and doesn't match.
- The `amdsmitst` gtest binary does not link the shared `.so` at all — it links a
  separate static archive built from the same sources, never installed/packaged. A
  static archive has no symbol-visibility restriction, so the test binary can call
  these methods directly.
- **Scope boundary, stated plainly**: `unit/` and `functional/` test sources compile
  into that same `amdsmitst` binary today. The real guarantee is "unreachable
  outside the test binary" — not "unreachable from functional/ tests specifically."
  A harder split would need a new build target; out of scope here.

## How to reuse this for a new device type or a new fake interface

1. **Register your processor** using the existing layer-1 seam on `AMDSmiSystem` —
   no new code needed for this step, regardless of processor type.
2. **Find out what your processor's methods actually touch** before assuming you
   need a new seam. Check: does it go through `get_mutex()`/`RocmSMI`? Does it read
   a fixed sysfs path? Does it call into ESMI, a vendor NIC library, or something
   else entirely? The answer differs per type (see the bullets above) — don't
   assume the GPU/RAS answer transfers.
3. **If a seam already exists for that backend** (e.g. `nic_info_getters_t` for
   NIC), reuse it. **If not**, add a minimal getter + setter pair (not
   `amdsmi_`-prefixed) and wrap it with the same `ScopedOverride<T>` template used
   here — don't write a new bespoke guard type.
4. **Write the test against the real public API function**, not an internal
   helper, using real temp-file/in-memory fixtures for whatever your seam
   redirects (see `FakeSysfsTree` for a reusable fixture-directory helper). Keep
   the guard-only discipline: no bare setters called directly from test bodies.
5. **Only fake as much of the call graph as your test needs.** For example, this
   fix's regression only needs the RAS mask read to fail — the early return happens
   before the per-block ECC-count loop runs, so that loop's own backend
   dependencies never needed faking here. Don't over-build fixtures for code paths
   your specific test doesn't reach.

## Explicitly out of scope for this fix

- Migrating the other ~12 `"/sys/class/drm/" + device->get_gpu_path()` call sites in
  `amd_smi_utils.cc` to the sysfs-root seam. Structure supports it; not done now.
- Full success-path coverage of `amdsmi_get_gpu_total_ecc_count()` through the
  public API for every RAS block. One block (UMC) is faked end-to-end —
  `RAS_FEATURES__ValidMaskOverwritesStaleOutput` writes a real `ras/umc_err_count`
  fixture to prove accumulation happens correctly and isn't contaminated by a
  stale/un-zeroed `*ec` — but the other ~20 blocks' `amdsmi_get_gpu_ecc_count()`
  dependencies remain unfaked; not needed beyond that one proof case.
- Actually adding CPU/NIC/switch/AI-NIC unit tests using the layer-1 seam — it's
  built and documented as reusable, but no such tests are added here.
- A dual-language shared fake-sysfs mechanism. A true one would need a second,
  test-only-exported shared library variant never shipped to customers — a
  separate, larger project. `tests/python/functional/gpu/test_ras.py`'s
  `test_get_gpu_total_ecc_count` was tightened to assert specific accepted
  statuses (`expect_status`/`status_sweep`) instead of the blanket
  `Test_API_Per_GPU`, and a `test_get_gpu_total_ecc_count_rejects_non_handle`
  test was added, but both still run against real hardware with no way to inject
  a malformed mask. A `unittest.mock.patch()`-based test that forces the
  underlying ctypes call to fail remains a reasonable cheaper alternative for
  that specific gap, deferred to a follow-up.

## Alternatives considered (brief)

- **Extract a pure `std::istream`-based parser**, testing only the line-parsing
  logic in isolation (matches the existing `smi_amdgpu_parse_od_clk_range`
  convention for pp_od_clk_voltage). Rejected as the primary approach: it exercises
  parsing only, not the real function's path construction, file I/O, or the public
  API's actual failure-handling behavior.
- **Environment-variable override** for the sysfs root. Rejected: the redirect
  logic would need to live in always-shipped production code, checked on every
  real call, in a library that often runs with elevated privileges to read GPU
  sysfs — a known hardening anti-pattern even when the intent is test-only.
