# HIP Record & Replay (HRR)

HRR captures HIP API traces into a binary archive and replays them on a live GPU for bug reproduction and validation.

## Note
HRR Capture is now disabled by default on AMD platforms. The feature will be securely re-enabled in a future release

## Capture

```bash
HIP_HRR_CAPTURE_OUTPUT=./my_capture.hrr ./my_hip_app
```

Use the in-tree `libamdhip64` from the **same source commit** when testing capture changes:

```bash
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<clr-build>/hipamd/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
HIP_HRR_CAPTURE_OUTPUT=./out.hrr ./my_hip_app
```

The capture runtime and `hrr-playback` share the generated HRR wire-format structs. For
capture/replay tests, build both `amdhip64` and `projects/hrr` from the same source
commit and use the same install prefix (or matching `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`) for both. Do
not capture with a prebuilt SDK runtime and replay with a checkout-built `hrr-playback`:
their generated payload layouts may differ, producing `payload too small` or missing
kernel/code-object errors.

## Build `hrr-playback`

`hrr-playback` builds standalone from `projects/hrr` against a capture-enabled
ROCm/HIP install prefix (the prefix that provides `hip::host` / `libamdhip64`):

```bash
cmake -S projects/hrr -B <hrr-build> \
  -DROCM_PATH="${ROCM_PATH:-/opt/rocm}" \
  -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="${ROCM_PATH:-/opt/rocm}" \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

cmake --build <hrr-build> --target hrr-playback -j"$(nproc)"
```

Locate the binary: `find <hrr-build> -name hrr-playback -type f`
(installed to `<prefix>/bin/hrr-playback`).

Details: [DESIGN.md § Build System](DESIGN.md#build-system).

## Inspecting and replaying captures

Point at a specific `pid-<pid>/` subdirectory when the capture root has multiple processes.

**Summary only (no GPU):**

```bash
hrr-playback ./my_capture.hrr/pid-<pid>/ --info
```

**Full replay** (Windows or Linux; requires AMD GPU and matching `hrr-playback` + HIP libraries):

```bash
hrr-playback ./my_capture.hrr/pid-<pid>/
```

**HIP library matching:** `hrr-playback` must load the same `libamdhip64` it was built against. If native replay fails with a symbol/version error (e.g. `hip_7.14 not found` from `/opt/rocm/lib`), either run with only the build tree on `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`:

```bash
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<clr-build>/hipamd/lib
hrr-playback ./my_capture.hrr/pid-<pid>/
```

Point `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` at the same `<clr-build>/hipamd/lib` used for capture when
`/opt/rocm/lib` triggers a symbol/version mismatch.

Useful flags when debugging a fault or hang: `--sync-after-launch`, `--sync-watchdog-ms N`, `--progress-seconds S`, `--trace-kernels`. See [Configuration reference](#configuration-reference) below.

## Configuration reference

User-facing capture, replay, and validation knobs. Implementation details can be found in [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md).

### Capture environment

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `HIP_HRR_CAPTURE_OUTPUT` | *(unset)* | Enable capture; path to the `.hrr` archive directory |
| `HIP_HRR_DEBUG_ARGS` | off | Dump every captured kernel arg to the log (debug / provenance) |

On Linux the archive is readable only by the user who captured it (directories 0700, files 0600). If the archive cannot be set up, capture is disabled with a `[HRR capture] Capture disabled` message on stderr and the application runs normally.

### `hrr-playback` CLI options

| Option | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `--info` | Print archive summary and exit (no GPU) |
| `--repair` | Rewrite a crash-truncated archive with a clean trailer; on an archive root, repairs every process capture and rebuilds the root index |
| `--events` | With `--info`: print the full event log |
| `--verbose` | Print each event as it is replayed |
| `--skip-device-sync` | Skip `hipDeviceSynchronize` / `hipStreamSynchronize` events |
| `--multi-thread` | One replay thread per captured thread (default: single-threaded) |
| `--timing` | Report wall time and GPU kernel/graph time |
| `--kernel-filter STR` | Only launch kernels whose name contains `STR` (warm-up pass first) |
| `--replace-kernel N=P` | Launch recorded kernel `N` from external code object `P` instead |
| `--sync-after-launch` | `hipDeviceSynchronize` after every kernel launch |
| `--sync-after-event` | Sync after every event (slow; pinpoints faults/hangs) |
| `--continue-on-error` | Report each HIP API error and keep replaying instead of aborting; for surveying which APIs fail, not for reproducing a fault |
| `--sync-watchdog-ms N` | Abort if any device sync exceeds `N` ms (`0` = disabled) |
| `--trace-kernels` | One compact line before every kernel launch |
| `--trace-sync` | Log sync begin/done around kernel syncs |
| `--progress-kernels N` | Heartbeat every `N` launched kernels |
| `--progress-seconds S` | Heartbeat at most every `S` seconds |
| `--version` | Print the archive format version this build reads, the revision it was built from, and the HIP runtime it is linked against, then exit (no GPU) |
| `--warn-untranslated-args` | Report kernel-arg pointers that resolve in no allocation, VMM reservation or region (they reach the GPU as null) — the measurement that says a capture lost allocations below the HIP API |
| `--no-regions` | Ignore any external region annotations in the archive |
| `--regions-strict` | Count intra-segment out-of-bounds findings toward the exit code (default: report only) |
| `--guard-segments` | VMM-back every device allocation and leave an unmapped span after it (diagnostic) |
| `--guard-blocks` | Relocate each annotated block behind a guard page for one launch (diagnostic; needs region annotations) |
| `--guard-min-bytes N` / `--guard-max-bytes N` | Size window for `--guard-blocks` |
| `--guard-budget-mb N` | Cap guarded memory per launch (default `4096`) |
| `--guard-exact-align` | Reproduce each guarded pointer's offset within an allocation granule bit for bit, at the cost of a larger unguarded tail |

### External region annotations

HRR interposes the HIP dispatch table, so it records the memory that crosses a
HIP API and nothing else. A framework allocator that carves per-object blocks out
of one large `hipMalloc` (PyTorch's HIP caching allocator) and a library that
allocates below HIP entirely (direct HSA, a foreign VMM pool, imported memory)
both leave HRR with a device VA range it cannot account for. A **producer**
outside the runtime writes those ranges down as
`pid-<pid>/regions/<name>.hrrr`; `hrr-playback` loads them automatically. See
[`producers/README.md`](producers/README.md) for the format and
[`producers/pytorch/hrr_torch_regions.py`](producers/pytorch/hrr_torch_regions.py)
for the reference PyTorch producer.

**Fidelity.** With annotations present and no guard flag, replay's memory layout
is exactly what it would have been without them; the annotations are read, not
acted on, except that a segment HIP never saw now gets allocated, so pointers
into it resolve instead of reaching the GPU as an address from another process.
Fidelity therefore only increases. The two `--guard-*` flags are the deliberate
exception: they move memory so that an out-of-bounds access faults instead of
landing in a live neighbour, and are off by default for that reason.
`--guard-blocks` restores every guarded block and releases the relocation before
the next event, so the divergence is confined to the launch under examination.

### Replay environment

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `HIP_HRR_REPLAY_ALLOC_PAD_FACTOR` | `1` | Multiply replayed `hipMalloc` size for pool-style headroom (`256` for legacy MIOpen-style workloads; uses more VRAM) |
| `HIP_HRR_REPLAY_ALLOC_PAD_MAX` | `1073741824` (1 GiB) | Cap per-allocation padded size |
| `HIP_HRR_REPLAY_ZERO_INIT` | on | Zero-fill replay allocations so OOB reads see zeros (`0` to skip) |
| `HIP_HRR_REPLAY_TRACE_KERNELS` | off | Same as `--trace-kernels` |
| `HIP_HRR_REPLAY_TRACE_SYNC` | off | Same as `--trace-sync` |
| `HIP_HRR_REPLAY_PROGRESS_KERNELS` | `0` | Same as `--progress-kernels N` |
| `HIP_HRR_REPLAY_PROGRESS_SECONDS` | `0` | Same as `--progress-seconds S` |
| `HIP_HRR_REPLAY_SYNC_WATCHDOG_MS` | `0` | Same as `--sync-watchdog-ms N` |
| `HIP_HRR_REPLAY_DIVERGENCE_ABORT` | `0.25` | Exit early when D2H failure ratio exceeds this fraction (`0` disables) |
| `HIP_HRR_REPLAY_DIVERGENCE_MIN_SAMPLES` | `64` | Minimum D2H attempts before divergence abort applies |
| `HIP_HRR_REPLAY_NO_RESCAN` | off | Disable suballoc pointer rescan at replay |
| `HIP_HRR_PTR_RELAX` | off | Disable replay-side stale-pointer guard (debug only) |
| `HIP_HRR_REPLAY_FORCE_EXT_CIJK` | off | Force external Cijk kernel binding workaround (debug) |
| `HIP_HRR_REPLAY_DUMP_PTRS_ORDINAL` | `0` | Dump pointer translation map, and the allocation each argument lands in, at kernel ordinal `N` (debug) |
| `HIP_HRR_REPLAY_SCAN_ARGS_ORDINAL` | `0` | Before kernel `N`, read back each pointer argument's allocation and report words that are recorded addresses (debug) |
| `HIP_HRR_REPLAY_SCAN_ARGS_BYTES` | `4096` | Per-allocation cap for the argument scan |
| `HIP_HRR_REPLAY_SCAN_H2D` | off | Report recorded addresses inside replayed H2D payloads (debug) |
| `HIP_HRR_REPLAY_AUDIT_HOST_ARGS` | off | Report kernels taking a pointer into host memory, whose contents replay cannot restore (debug) |
| `HIP_HRR_REPLAY_FILL_BYTE` | `0` | Byte to fill fresh allocations with; set it to e.g. `0xa5` to expose kernels reading memory nothing wrote (debug) |
| `HIP_HRR_REPLAY_EXPLAIN_ADDR` | unset | At the scan ordinal, report whether an address is recorded, live, or neither, and whether the GPU can read it (debug) |

### D2H validation

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `HIP_HRR_D2H_ATOL` | tuned for bf16/fp16 | Absolute tolerance for float D2H compare |
| `HIP_HRR_D2H_RTOL` | tuned for bf16/fp16 | Relative tolerance for float D2H compare |
| `HIP_HRR_D2H_EXACT` | off | Require byte-exact D2H match (disable tolerance) |

**Exit codes:** `0` pass; `1` D2H failure; `2` early divergence abort.

## Archive layout (short)

```
capture.hrr/
  manifest.json
  pid-<pid>/
    events.bin
    blobs/
    code_objects/
    regions/          (optional)
    manifest.json
```

- **events.bin** — HIP API event stream
- **regions/** — external region annotations, if a producer ran: memory the HIP
  dispatch table never saw. Written by code outside the runtime, never by
  capture itself
- **blobs/** — host payloads referenced by the trace
- **code_objects/** — code objects, content-addressed by hash (device images
  extracted by the runtime, or the raw file for `hipModuleLoad`); a launch
  records the hash so kernels sharing a name (Triton emits many `triton_`)
  still resolve to the code object they came from
- **Complete: NO** — original run crashed before clean shutdown; reader still recovers complete events

Code objects read back from the runtime must start with `\x7fELF`,
`__CLANG_OFFLOAD_BUNDLE__` or `CCOB`; capture warns and records none rather
than storing an image that fails only at replay with HIP error 200.

Capture wire version must match the `hrr-playback` reader (see DESIGN.md wire-format notes).

## Agent tooling

Optional Cursor/agent skill: [skills/decode-and-triage/SKILL.md](skills/decode-and-triage/SKILL.md).
**Linux:** full workflow via `triage_archive.sh` (native replay, optional Docker replay, auto-build).
**Windows:** full native replay via `triage_archive.ps1` + `ensure_playback.ps1`; Docker replay
requires Linux or WSL2. Docker replay uses the image HRR stack by default; set
`HRR_DOCKER_MOUNT_CLR=1` to overlay a host dev build (`CLR_BUILD` / `HRR_PLAYBACK`).
