  hrr_capture.sh run --output PATH [--playback PATH] -- <command> [args...]
  hrr_capture.sh verify --output PATH [--playback PATH] [--json] [--no-playback]

  preflight  Check this environment can capture: which HIP runtime the workload
             will load, whether it has capture built in, and whether the output
             path is big enough and outlives the container. Give it the command
             after --: a binary's own RPATH beats every path a search can see,
             so without the command this answers a weaker question.
  run        Preflight, then run the command with capture enabled, then verify.
  verify     Report what an existing archive contains.

Options:
  --output PATH        Archive directory to write (run/verify: required)
  --playback PATH      hrr-playback to cross-check the archive with. It has to be
                       the one matching the runtime that captured, or it will
                       refuse the archive over its format version
  --json               verify: emit JSON instead of text
  --no-playback        verify: report from the manifests only, no cross-check
  --skip-preflight     run: do not preflight at all
  --force              run: proceed even when preflight fails, for any reason:
                       no capture-capable runtime, too little space, or an
                       output path that will not outlive the container
  --min-free-gb N      Minimum free space to insist on (default 50)

Requires Linux, bash, GNU coreutils and python3. This script never selects a
GPU: whatever device mask the workload already uses is left alone, because
capture has to record the run being reproduced.
