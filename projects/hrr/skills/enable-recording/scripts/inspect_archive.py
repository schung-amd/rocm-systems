"""Report what an HRR capture archive actually contains.

Answers the only question that matters right after a capture run: did anything
get recorded, and is the archive worth sending on. It works without a GPU and
without `hrr-playback`, reading the manifests the capture writer leaves behind,
and uses `hrr-playback --info` as a cross-check when a compatible one is around.

Two properties of the on-disk layout drive the logic here:

* The **root manifest is written best-effort by whichever process last flushed
  it**, so its per-process counts can lag the truth. The per-process
  `pid-<pid>/manifest.json` is authoritative and is what this reports.
* A process killed hard may leave `events.bin` with **no manifest at all**.
  That is a capture with unknown counts, not an empty one, so it is reported as
  recorded-but-unfinalized rather than as a failure.

`complete: false` is likewise not an error. It means the clean-shutdown trailer
is missing, which is exactly what a workload that crashed is supposed to look
like.
